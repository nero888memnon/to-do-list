# to-do-list
This is a minimalist, browser-based To-Do List application designed to help users stay organized with tasks across personal, work, and shopping categories. Built using only HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the app stores all data in the browser's localStorageâ€”meaning no backend or account is needed.

Users can add new tasks with custom due dates, categories, and priority levels. Tasks can be edited, marked as complete, or deleted. A clean interface and modal form make managing to-dos simple and efficient. Task cards are visually styled to reflect their priority, helping users focus on what matters most.

Features:

Add, edit, and delete tasks

Set due dates, priorities, and categories

Mark tasks as complete with checkbox tracking

Task persistence via browser localStorage

Clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
